**`IA Programming`**

I am currently a 3rd year student at EPITA, I am passionate about programming and more particularly about artificial intelligence. Given the arrival of AI with ChatGPT in our daily life, I thought it was a field that would appeal to me.
ðŸŒ± At school we have not yet started the AI courses but I am already training on the subject using the CS50 harvard course and the ZTM (tensorflow) course on UDEMY. Here are some projects that I have done in self-taught:
- Self driver car in Javascript using a neural network
- A Tic-tac-toe game with unbeatable AI in python
- A Minesweeper game with an AI that gives you clues in python
- A crossword in python
