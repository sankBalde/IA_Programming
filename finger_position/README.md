# Virtual Keyboard Project

This project offers a virtual keyboard that utilizes hand motion detection to simulate text input. Users can interact with the keyboard by moving their hands in front of a camera to select keys, write text, and control certain functionalities such as character deletion and toggling between uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Mediapipe
- Functional webcam

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have installed all the necessary dependencies listed in the prerequisites.
2. Run the Python script on your terminal or development environment.
3. Position yourself in front of the webcam so that your hands are visible to the camera.
4. Use your hands to interact with the virtual keyboard keys.
5. Hand movements will select different keys on the virtual keyboard to write text.
6. To delete a character, use the "DEL" key.
7. To add a space between words, use the "Space" key.
8. To toggle between uppercase and lowercase letters, use the "UP" key.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection.
- Selection of virtual keyboard keys based on hand movements.
- Real-time writing of inputted text on the screen.
- Control over character deletion, adding spaces, and toggling between uppercase and lowercase letters.
